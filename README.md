# SnortAna
Show what's in a ruleset for Snort Rules

# What's this?
It's a really really really easy work for analysing the things in a snort ruleset
Such as:
"How many complex RE in this ruleset?"
"How many hex in this ruleset?"
"How many of the rules ignore port/proto?"
....
I may add more functions according to the need of my research
if you need, it can also list all of them (which may overflow your screen)

# How to use
It's written with Python3.9. You need a comportable version of python to run it
1. edit the filename in the code
2. run
